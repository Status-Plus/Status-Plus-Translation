# Status-Plus-Translation

This is the hub for translating StatusPlus tools!

For now, we only accept translation for the bot of StatusPlus. 

To start, please fork the repo, enter the folder, and create a JSON file. For ideas as to what the strings look like, check the EN.json file. Please name the JSON file as the official language code of that language (ISO 639-1 standard), i.e. EN.json. Once you are complete, make a pull request into the repo!  

If you wish to contribute to this, please do make sure you actually understand the language you are adding/modifying, and not using a translator.
